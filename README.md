# âš¡ Vue 3 + Vite + TanStack Table v8 (vue port) + TailwindCSS ðŸŽ¨ 

This TanStack Table v8 used with vue originally has no style, thus it's entirely styled by TailwindCSS through variables in main.css and DataTable.vue template standard Tailwind styling.
Also, I'm utilizing no TypeScript in Vue as well to prove it's truly optional. This is a tremendously basic TanStack table, but this is a PoC to prove the concept of integration without issues and logically the additional TanStack features are logical additions.The hover bg color is different for the row my cursor is on in my screenshot.
